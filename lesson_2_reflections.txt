-- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
* 
  1) Git creates its metadata in that directory in order to keep track of changes.
  2) This way you can use git with a new project or with a project without version control.

-- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

* It is different from the working directory and the repository because it is only used as an intermediate state. It allows us to have deeper control over the content of our commits.
