-- When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* When you intend to publish and share your code or content.


-- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
* Because otherwise massive amounts of bandwidth would be wasted and you wouldn't be able to work on a project that is always changing (like the Linux project).
